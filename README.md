# Welcome to Realistic Seasons

## About the Mod

This is a mod that adds the four major seasons we experience here on Earth to the World of Minecraft! The hope is that this will add some additional immersion to your world. Currently, the day-night cycle is a rather static experience. I have always wanted to see this day-night cycle change with time, just like it does (at most latitudes) on our planet. Now since Minecraft isn't exactly a globe like the Earth is, and that there aren't orbital mechanics in the Minecraft world, this day-night cycle will not change with respect to your location in the world. Minecraft is _flat_ of course! (**and the Earth is not... so yeah.**)

It will be similar to how the day-night cycle is experienced at around 55° N latitude. I think this is a good starting point. Perhaps some settings will be added later on in development so you can adjust what "latitude" you are at. This will allow some freedom as to how long the day-night cycle will be throughout a Minecraft "year", which will be determined as well.

### Dynamic Day-Night Cycle

The minecraft year (as soon as you spawn into your world) will start off during the spring. You will see that the day and night will be even most of the time. As spring turns to summmer, the day will be at it's longest point while the nights will be short. Summer gives way to the Fall and the days and nights will even out again (much like the spring). As winter begins, nights will be much longer and the days become short.

#### Day-Night Cycle Lengths (subject to change)

|**Season**|Spring|Summer|Fall|Winter|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Day Length**|11m|16m|9m|4m|
|**Night Length**|9m|4m|11m|16m|

### Angle of the Sun

So on the Earth, our seasons change due to the tilt of the planet. This effects the angle of the sun in the sky (depending on your latitude). In Minecraft, the sun angle stays about the same. So in this mod, the angle of the sun _will_ change with respect to the season. The sun will not move slower or faster, but the sun will be higher or lower in the sky depending on the season.

#### Sun Angle (subject to change)

|**Season**|Spring|Summer|Fall|Winter|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Angle**|0°|0°|0°|0°|

### Changes in Weather

But that is just _part_ of the experience we have with seasons. We also get a change in weather! So depending on the season, the weather in your world will change. So the year will start at the beginning of spring. You'll get more rainfall during this season, depending on the biome you are in. Eventually summer rolls around, the rain will become less frequent. As you move into fall, the rain will begin to pick back up (not as much as during the spring) and you will occasionally see some snowfall. Then the dreaded (unless you like the cold) winter will finally come. Snow and maybe even some ice will fall in most biomes during this time.

#### Weather Effects (subject to change)

|**Season**|Spring|Summer|Fall|Winter|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Weather**|Rain|Rain|Rain/Snow|Snow|
|<a name="freq">**Frequency**</a>1|4|2|3/1|3|

<sup>[1](#freq)</sup>** describes the rarity of the weather event, 3 is high and 1 is low.

### Changes in Foilage

So we have weather and the changes in the day-night cycle. What else? Well, foilage of the trees and the grass change too! During the spring, leaves will be sparse slowly becoming more apparent and will be bright, as well as the grass. During the summer, trees will display their full leaf collection and the colors will mellow out. During the fall, leaves will fall! The foilage will be vibrant reds, oranges, and purples. The grass will also begin to slowly change color as well. In the winter, everything is dead (except for spruce trees!).
